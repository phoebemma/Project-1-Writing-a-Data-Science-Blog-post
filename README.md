## Installation
The following Python libraries are needed to run the codes
* Pandas
* Numpy
* Seaborn
* Matplotlib.pyplot
* Missingno
## Motivation
Part of my doctoral research includes analyses of antimicrobial resistaance data, 
this was the biggest motivation for checking the level of awareness regarding 
antibiotics abuse in European Union countries. I know access to antibiotics (just like most drugs) is highly regulated, 
I wanted to check if people understood why. The questions I hope to be able to answer after analyses are
* 1. What is the average rate of antibiotics usage within the region?
* 2. Part of fighting antibiotics resistance lies in regulating access to antibiotics, can antibiotics be obtained in EU without medical prescription?
* 3. Are the people within the region informed enough on how antibiotics are abused?
