## Motivation
Part of my doctoral research includes analyses of antimicrobial resistaance data, 
this was the biggest motivation for checking the level of awareness regarding 
antibiotics abuse in European Union countries. I know access to antibiotics (just like most drugs) is highly regulated, 
I wanted to check if people understood why.
